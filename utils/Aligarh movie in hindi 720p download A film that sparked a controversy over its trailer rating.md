The film has a minimalist and subtle style that lets the performances and the emotions shine through. The film has a haunting background score by Karan Kulkarni that complements the mood of the film.

He captures the vulnerability, the pain, and the dignity of Siras with his expressive eyes and body language. He delivers some of the most memorable scenes in the film, such as his recitation of a poem by Dushyant Kumar, his interview with Rajkummar Rao, and his final moments in the film.
